# Firebase Dynamic Links Sunset Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the migration performed on May 13th, 2025 to address the upcoming Firebase Dynamic Links sunset scheduled for August 25th, 2025. Firebase Dynamic Links is being discontinued, which impacts Firebase Authentication features that rely on it, particularly email verification and password reset flows.

## Impact Assessment

The following authentication features in our application were affected:

- Email verification links sent during user signup
- Resending verification emails
- Password reset via email
- Email verification status checking during login

## Migration Changes

### 1. Modernized Firebase SDK Implementation

- Created a centralized Firebase initialization file using the modular SDK approach:
  - Created `js/firebase-init.js` to replace the older compat-based initialization
  - Updated all imports to use the modular pattern

### 2. Email Verification Updates

- Updated all email verification sending code to include `handleCodeInApp: true`
- Modified the verification flow in the following files:
  - `js/auth.js`: Updated the email verification sending in signup and resend functions
  - `html/login.html`: Added proper verification handling and resend capability

### 3. Password Reset Updates

- Updated password reset email sending to include `handleCodeInApp: true`
- Modified the reset flow in:
  - `js/auth.js`: Updated the password reset function
  - `html/forgot-password.html`: Updated to use the new approach

### 4. Module Loading Fixes

- Added `type="module"` to all script tags that include Firebase modules
- Updated import paths to use CDN URLs for Firebase modules

## Code Changes

### Key Code Patterns Updated

#### Before Migration:

```javascript
// Email verification
await user.sendEmailVerification({
    url: window.location.origin + '/html/login.html?verified=true',
    handleCodeInApp: false
});

// Password reset
await firebase.auth().sendPasswordResetEmail(email);
```

#### After Migration:

```javascript
// Email verification
const actionCodeSettings = {
    url: window.location.origin + '/html/login.html?verified=true',
    // This must be true for production apps after Dynamic Links sunset
    handleCodeInApp: true
};
await sendEmailVerification(user, actionCodeSettings);

// Password reset
const actionCodeSettings = {
    url: window.location.origin + '/html/login.html',
    // This must be true for production apps after Dynamic Links sunset
    handleCodeInApp: true
};
await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, email, actionCodeSettings);
```

## 1. System Architecture

The Gandi-Hub Academics Dashboard follows a client-side architecture with cloud synchronization:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript provide the user interface and core functionality
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach using localStorage (client-side) and Firebase Firestore (cloud)
- **Synchronization**: Real-time data synchronization between local storage and cloud
- **Notifications**: Advanced toast notification system for user feedback
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for academic performance visualization

The application follows a modular design pattern with separate components for:
- Calendar management
- Event handling
- Data synchronization
- User interface components
- Notification system

## 2. Key Features

### Calendar Management System

- Upcoming events section with type-specific styling
- Date and time selection with validation

### Event Management
- Create, view, and manage different types of academic events
- Type-specific event handling and display
- Validation for required fields
- Real-time updates to calendar and event lists

### Training Session Management
- Dedicated training session creation and management
- Specialized storage in Firestore training collection
- Visual differentiation in calendar and upcoming events

## 3. Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with Bootstrap 5.3.0 framework
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for functionality

### Backend/Database

## 5. Core Components

### CalendarManager
Responsible for rendering and managing the calendar interface, including:
- Calendar generation and display
- Date selection handling
- Event indicators on calendar dates
- Modal interactions for event creation

### EventManager
Handles all event-related operations:
- Event creation and validation
- Event storage and retrieval
- Event display in calendar and lists
- Event type management

### Firebase Integration
Manages cloud synchronization with Firestore:
- Data persistence across devices
- User identification
- Collection management for different data types
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Notification System
Provides visual feedback to users:
- Toast notifications with progress bars
- Type-specific styling (success, warning, error)
- Sound effects for important notifications
- Accessibility features for screen readers

## 6. Event Management System

The event management system supports multiple event types:

### Event Types
1. **Regular Events**: General academic events
2. **Training Sessions**: Video or in-person training
3. **Study Groups**: Collaborative study sessions
4. **Exams**: Tests and assessments

### Event Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: Number,              // Unique identifier
  title: String,           // Event title
  date: String,            // Event date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  time: String,            // Event time (HH:MM)
  location: String,        // Event location
  description: String,     // Event description
  type: String,            // Event type (event, training, study, exam)
  createdAt: String,       // Creation timestamp
  userId: String           // User identifier
}
```

### Training Session Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: Number,              // Unique identifier
  title: String,           // Training title
  date: String,            // Training date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  time: String,            // Training time (HH:MM)
  location: String,        // Training location
  description: String,     // Training description
  type: 'training',        // Fixed as training
  userId: String,          // User identifier
  participants: Array,     // Array of participant IDs
  status: String,          // Status (scheduled, completed, etc.)
  createdAt: Timestamp,    // Firestore server timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp     // Firestore server timestamp
}
```

### Event Creation Process
1. User selects event type and opens form
2. User fills in event details
3. System validates required fields
4. Event is saved to localStorage
5. Event is synchronized to Firestore
6. Calendar and event lists are updated
7. Success notification is displayed

## 7. Firebase Integration

### Firestore Collections
- **events**: General calendar events
- **training**: Training-specific events
- **users**: User profiles and settings

### Security Rules
The Firestore security rules allow read/write access to all collections for development purposes. In production, these should be restricted to authenticated users with proper permissions.

### Data Synchronization
1. Events are first saved to localStorage for immediate access
2. Events are then synchronized to Firestore for cloud persistence
3. On page load, the system checks localStorage first
4. If no local data is found, it fetches from Firestore
5. Training sessions are stored in a dedicated collection

### Error Handling
- Permission denied errors are caught and reported to the user
- Network errors trigger fallback to localStorage
- Data validation occurs before saving to prevent corruption

## 8. User Interface

### Calendar View
- Month-based calendar with date selection
- Visual indicators for dates with events
- Color-coding based on event type
- Quick-add buttons for different event types

### Upcoming Events Section
- List of nearest future events
- Type-specific styling and icons
- Date and time information
- Quick-add buttons for new events

### Event Creation Modal
- Form for entering event details
- Type selection dropdown
- Required field validation
- Date and time pickers

### Training Section
- Dedicated view for training sessions
- Visual differentiation from other events
- Duration indicators
- Add Training button for quick creation

## 9. Notification System

### Toast Notifications
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Type-specific styling (success, warning, error)
- Progress bar showing notification duration
- Hover-pause functionality

### Enhanced Features
- Sound effects for important notifications
- Accessibility support with ARIA attributes
- Semi-transparent backgrounds with border accents
- Smooth animations for better user experience

## 10. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Firebase account for cloud synchronization

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure Firebase credentials in firebase-config.js
3. Deploy Firestore security rules from firebase-rules.txt
4. Open academics.html in a web browser

### Firebase Configuration
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

## 11. Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Temporary user ID generation for data association
- Open Firestore rules for development
- Client-side data validation

### Production Recommendations
- Implement user authentication
- Restrict Firestore access to authenticated users
- Server-side data validation
- HTTPS for all communications
- Proper API key management

## 12. Known Limitations

- Requires modern browser support
- Dependent on internet connectivity for cloud sync
- Temporary user ID generation
- Limited offline functionality
- No user authentication system

## 13. Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements
- Implement user authentication
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests for core functionalities
- Enhance accessibility features

### Long-term Roadmap
- Implement advanced filtering and sorting for events
- Add recurring event support
- Create user roles and permissions
- Develop mobile applications
- Implement real-time collaboration features
- Add calendar sharing functionality
- Integrate with external calendar systems (Google, Outlook)
